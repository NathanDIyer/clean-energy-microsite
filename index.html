            <p>Solar's low cost comes from its simplicity: no fuel, minimal operations. It's 86% upfront capital cost. But this raises a question: <em>what happens if you can't use all the energy you generate?</em></p>

            <div class="callout">
                <strong>Wind behaves differently:</strong> Wind's output is spread across more hours, giving it a ~94% ceiling without any storage. Storage helps solar far more—but storage is expensive. The next chart shows exactly how costly a solar-only path becomes.

                <strong>The overbuild trap:</strong> To reach 80% clean with solar+5h storage costs over $150/MWh—triple what an optimized portfolio achieves. Each storage hour adds cost but only raises the ceiling by ~6 points. This is why diversity matters.

                <strong>Partial solution:</strong> Even 8 hours of storage only lifts solar's capacity credit from ~1% to ~55%. The fundamental problem is seasonal—winter days are shorter, and no amount of daily storage can fix that.

            <h2>What If No Clean Firm Power?</h2>
            <p>Clean firm technologies are still emerging. What if we can't rely on them?</p>
            <div id="chart-no-cleanfirm" class="chart-container"></div>
            <div class="callout danger">
                <strong>Critical finding:</strong> Without clean firm, costs explode at high targets. A 95% target becomes 40% more expensive. 99% may be impractical.

            <h2>Clean Firm Technology Paths</h2>
            <p>Not all clean firm technologies are equal. Their economics vary dramatically with financing costs:</p>
            <div id="chart-cleanfirm-tech" class="chart-container"></div>
            <ul class="region-notes">
                <li><strong>Geothermal:</strong> Zero fuel = 100% capex. Cheapest at low discount rates, but very sensitive to financing.</li>
                <li><strong>Nuclear:</strong> High capex, low fuel. Expensive but predictable.</li>
                <li><strong>Hydrogen:</strong> Low capex, high fuel. Less sensitive to financing, higher floor cost.</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- 5.5 Financing Impact -->
        <section id="financing" class="section">
            <h2>Financing Matters More Than Tax Credits</h2>
            <p>Policy debates focus on tax credits. But for capital-intensive clean energy, financing costs may matter even more:</p>
            <div id="chart-financing" class="chart-container"></div>
            <div class="callout">
                <strong>Policy implication:</strong> Reducing financing costs (loan guarantees, green banks, de-risking) can be as powerful as tax credits—and helps all clean technologies.

        <!-- 5.6 What If No Wind? -->
        <section id="no-wind" class="section">
            <h2>What If No Wind?</h2>
            <p>Some regions like Florida have limited wind. Here's what happens:</p>
            <div id="chart-no-wind" class="chart-container"></div>
            <p class="insight">Without wind, clean firm becomes even more critical. Solar + storage alone can't get you there affordably.</p>

        <!-- 5.7 The Greedy Trap -->
        <section id="greedy-trap" class="section">
            <h2>The Optimization Trap</h2>
            <p>The intuitive approach—keep adding whichever resource gives the best $/MWh improvement—fails at high targets:</p>
            <div id="chart-greedy" class="chart-container"></div>
            <div class="callout">
                <strong>The penalty grows with ambition:</strong> At 70%, greedy and optimal converge. By 99%, greedy costs 10% more—overbuilding cheap solar/wind instead of investing in reliability.

                    <h3>Clean Firm Is the Keystone</h3>
                    <p>Developing affordable clean firm power (hydrogen, advanced geothermal, next-gen nuclear) is critical for affordable decarbonization beyond 90%.</p>

                    <h3>95% Is the Sweet Spot</h3>
                    <p>Getting from 95% to 100% is disproportionately expensive. A 95% clean grid may be the pragmatic near-term target.</p>
